# Roommate+

Roommate+ is an algorithmic roommate matching platform for college students. It was developed as a project for Hack Duke 2024 by Alec Yang, Arjun Saha Choudhury, Zachary Kuo, and James Xiao.

## Background

As a group of four freshmen, we understand the challenges of finding a roommateâ€”especially during the transition from East Campus to West Campus. Inspired in part by the Duke Marriage Pact, we set out to create a website that streamlines the roommate-finding process, making it faster and more efficient. Roommate+ provides users with a short survey and then employs a matching algorithm to pair them with someone whose responses align closely with their interests and lifestyle. Our platform allows users to find a compatible roommate based on their preferences in just five minutes, eliminating the need for time-consuming face-to-face meetings.
 
## Components

We developed Roommate+ using Node.js and MongoDB for the backend, while the frontend was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The core matching algorithm was written in Java to efficiently process and compare user responses.

## Reflection

As freshmen with little prior experience in web development, we are incredibly proud of both the aesthetics and functionality of our website. Over the course of this project, we pushed ourselves to learn new technologies and successfully built a platform that works as intended.

One of our biggest challenges was integrating the backend, frontend, and matching algorithm. Since each component was built with different technologies and databases, ensuring seamless communication between them required extensive troubleshooting and problem-solving.

One of our team members learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch during the hackathon, while another picked up MongoDB and Node.js. Beyond technical skills, we gained valuable experience in brainstorming, rapid prototyping, and efficient teamwork under tight deadlines.

Moving forward, we plan to expand Roommate+ beyond roommate matching. Our vision includes helping students connect with study partners, tutors, and even potential colleges that fit their academic and personal preferences.
